# iOS Distribution Guide for BrainiumX

## Prerequisites
- Apple Developer Account ($99/year)
- Access to macOS machine or CI/CD service

## Option 1: GitHub Actions (Automated)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build iOS
3. Download the build artifacts
4. Upload to TestFlight

## Option 2: Manual Build (requires macOS)
```bash
# On macOS machine
flutter build ios --release
```

## TestFlight Setup
1. **App Store Connect**:
   - Create new app in App Store Connect
   - Bundle ID: `com.yourname.brainiumx`
   - App Name: BrainiumX

2. **Upload to TestFlight**:

   - Upload the .ipa file
   - Add beta testers by email

3. **Share with Friends**:

   - They can test your app

## Alternative: Direct Distribution

2. Or use services like Diawi for ad-hoc distribution
